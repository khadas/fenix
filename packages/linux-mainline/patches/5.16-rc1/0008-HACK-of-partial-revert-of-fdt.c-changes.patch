Subject: [PATCH 08/58] HACK: of: partial revert of fdt.c changes

This resolves reports similar to the below which are present in dmesg
since Linux 5.10; which are also causing crashes in some distros:

[    0.000000] OF: fdt: Reserved memory: failed to reserve memory for node 'secmon@5000000': base 0x0000000005000000, size 3 MiB
